B) Computing Normals to Polyhedron Faces, for use in Illumination Equations.

1. Write down the vector components of this cross-product (explicitly in terms of x1, y1, etc.)

-> [(P2 - P1) ⨯ (P3 - P2)] = [ z3(y2-y1) + z2(y1-y3) + z1(y3-y2),
                               x3(z2-z1) + x2(z1-z3) + x1(z3-z2),
                               y3(x2-x1) + y2(x1-x3) + y1(x3-x2) ]

2. There are six identical forms of this particular normal direction, written in terms of the cross products of (P2-P1), (P3-P2), and (P1-P3).
Three of these six identical forms are basically different in their apparent from, and three other forms are derived from one of the first three, with order and sign changes.
Write down these six equivalent forms.

-> [(P2 - P1) ⨯ (P3 - P2)] = [ z3(y2-y1) + z2(y1-y3) + z1(y3-y2),
                               x3(z2-z1) + x2(z1-z3) + x1(z3-z2),
                               y3(x2-x1) + y2(x1-x3) + y1(x3-x2) ]

   [(P3 - P2) ⨯ (P1 - P3)] = [ z3(y2-y1) + z2(y1-y3) + z1(y3-y2),
                               x3(z2-z1) + x2(z1-z3) + x1(z3-z2),
                               y3(x2-x1) + y2(x1-x3) + y1(x3-x2) ]

   [(P2 - P1) ⨯ (P1 - P3)] = [ y2(z1-z3) + y1(z3-z2) + y3(z2-z1),
                               z2(x1-x3) + z1(x3-x2) + z3(x2-x1),
                               x2(y1-y3) + x1(y3-y2) + x3(y2-y1) ]

   [(P3 - P2) x (P2 - P1)] = [ y3(z2-z1) + y2(z1-z3) + y1(z3-z2),
                               z3(x2-x1) + z2(x1-x3) + z1(x3-x2),
                               x3(y2-y1) + x2(y1-y3) + x1(y3-y2) ]

   [(P1 - P3) x (P3 - P2)] = [ y3(z2-z1) + y2(z1-z3) + y1(z3-z2),
                               z3(x2-x1) + z2(x1-x3) + z1(x3-x2),
                               x3(y2-y1) + x2(y1-y3) + x1(y3-y2) ]

   [(P2 - P1) x (P3 - P2)] = [ z3(y2-y1) + z2(y1-y3) + z1(y3-y2),
                               x3(z2-z1) + x2(z1-z3) + x1(z3-z2),
                               y3(x2-x1) + y2(x1-x3) + y1(x3-x2) ]



C) Ambient Illumination and Diffuse Illumination

1. According to lamberts law the intensity of the light getting reflected from the illuminated surface would be equal from any position for the moving observer.
Hence the observer perceives same amount of light irrespective of its position.

2.
a) What physical process does the ambient color for an object's material specification approximate?

-> Ambient color is the color an object reflects when it is not exposed to direct light. Hence the object's material needs to specify the reflection.

b) What is the mathematical expression for the geometric factor for diffuse illumination, as dependence on the vectors given above?

-> Id = Kd * Lp * (N . L)
   where L  = light vector,
         N  = surface normal,
         Kd = reflection vector,
         Lp = light point vector


D) Flat Shading and Gouraud Shading

1. Which one is required for the "flat shading model" to get the proper effect?

-> One normal per face. By this we can compute the illumination at that point and shade the entire face.

2. If you were to implement a hardware-accelerated Gouraud shading interpolation, which feature of contemporary graphics processors would you use, and how would you use it?

-> I would use the `Vertex Shader` to calculate the position of the vertices and the `Fragment Shader` to get the color for those vertices.

3. List all geometrical primitives necessary as input data for a programmable pipeline to compute diffuse lighting, explain each one of these primitive's roles in the Gouraud shading process, and describe the output of such shading process.

-> The coordinates for the vertices of the surface to calculate the normals at each vertex.



E) Phong Illumination

1. What is the geometric factor for Phong specular lighting with shininess f ?

-> Is = ks * (R · Pc)^f * Pl
   where ks = specular light coefficient,
         R  = reflection vector,
         Pc = camera vector,
         Pl = light vector,
         f = shininess

2. Under what conditions should the Phong specular lighting component be set to zero?

-> Phong specular lighting component should be set to zero when the surface is less shiny(example: wooden surface) hence allowing maximum diffusion. If in such case the Phong specular lighting component is set to a higher value there are chaances that the reflected area from the surface shows a visible cut.
