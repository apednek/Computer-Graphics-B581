A) 3D Geometry

a) Consider a Rotation that is the result of multiplying three Rotations: Rx * Ry * Rz .
The fixed point of those Rotations is the origin.
The angles of rotation, for those three individual Rotations, are Θx, Θy, and Θz  respectively.
Provide the result as a single 4x4 matrix, explicitly writing down the expression for each element in the resulting matrix.
(i.e. the mathematical expression in each one of the 16 elements in the 4x4 matrix needs to be written down explicitly)

Rx = |1     0               0           0|
     |0     cos(θx)      -sin(θx)       0|
     |0     sin(θx)       cos(θx)       0|
     |0     0               0           1|


Ry = |cos(θy)     0       sin(θy)       0|
     |0           1          0          0|
     |-sin(θy)    0       cos(θy)       0|
     |0           0          0          1|


Rz = |cos(θz)     -sin(θz)      0       0|
     |sin(θz)      cos(θz)      0       0|
     |0                0        1       0|
     |0                0        0       1|

Result as a single 4x4 matrix:

Rx*Ry*Rz = |cos(θy)cos(θz)                              -sin(θz)cos(θy)                             sin(θy)                 0|
           |sin(θx)sin(θy)cos(θz)+sin(θz)cos(θx)        -sin(θx)sin(θy)sin(θz)+cos(θx)cos(θz)       -sin(θx)cos(θy)         0|
           |sin(θx)sin(θz)−sin(θy)cos(θx)cos(θz)        sin(θx)cos(θz)+sin(θy)sin(θz)cos(θx)        cos(θx)cos(θy)          0|
           |0                                           0                                           0                       1|


b) By definition, an instance transformation is the product of a Translation, a Rotation, and a Scaling, multiplied together in that order: T*R*S. When working with 3D homogeneous coordinates, T, R and S are 4x4 matrices.
For example, if a set of vertices is transformed by such an instance transformation, Scaling is the transformation that gets applied to those vertices first, and Translation gets applied last.
Can we obtain the same result by combining those same three types of transformations, in a different order?
If yes, why?
If not, why not?

Consider translation by (2,2,2), scaling by (2,2,2) and rotation on the x-y plane of (30) for a point originally at (3,3,3).

Performing scaling first then rotation then translation:
T(2,2,2) * R(30) * S(2,2,2) * P(3,3,3) = |4.19 |
                                         |10.19|
                                         |8    |
                                         |1    |

Performing transalation first then rotation then scaling:
S(2,2,2) * R(30) * T(2,2,2) * P(3,3,3) = |3.66 |
                                         |13.66|
                                         |10   |
                                         |1    |

These results state that the same results cannot be applied if the transformations are applied in a different order.

B) 3D Transformations
a) Write down the 4x4 right-handed rotation matrix that leaves the y-axis fixed.

Ry = |cos(θy)     0       sin(θy)       0|
     |0           1          0          0|
     |-sin(θy)    0       cos(θy)       0|
     |0           0          0          1|

b) Write down the 4x4 right-handed rotation matrix that leaves the z-axis fixed.

Rz = |cos(θz)     -sin(θz)      0       0|
     |sin(θz)      cos(θz)      0       0|
     |0                0        1       0|
     |0                0        0       1|

c) Write down the 4x4 ModelView matrix performing a right-handed rotation that leaves fixed in space every point on the line that passes from the point (1,1,0) to (1,1,1).

To have a point rotating about an arbitrary axis we need to have the unit vector in the direction of the rotation axis and the angle of rotation.

The given line segment is P1(1,1,0) and P2(1,1,1) which would be our arbitrary axis.
This line segment is along the z axis therefore the unit vector is along the z axis.
Consider θ as the angle of rotation.

Therefore the ModelView matrix results to:
Rz = |cos(θz)     -sin(θz)      0       0|
     |sin(θz)      cos(θz)      0       0|
     |0                0        1       0|
     |0                0        0       1|

Where a positive θ corresponds to the counter-clockwise rotation.
