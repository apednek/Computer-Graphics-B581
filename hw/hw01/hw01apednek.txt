B) 
1.) For any liquid ‘l’ both the scales would have the same temperature value. Let us call this temperature as ‘a’ on temperature scale A which lies between the freezing and boiling point Af and Ab. 
Similarly for temperature scale B let us call this temperature as ‘b’ which lies between the freezing and boiling point Bf and Bb.
Ideally, ‘a’ and ‘b’ are equal since it’s the same temperature of that liquid but on two different scales.
Therefore,
(a – Af) / a = (b – Bf) / b
Hence the conversion formulas result into:
a = (b * Af) / Bf
and
b = (a * Bf) / Af


2.) Water freezing point (i.e., when t = 0) -> 0C and 32F
Water boiling point (i.e., when t = 1) -> 100C and 212F
Fahrenheit to Celsius:
F(t) = 1.8 * C(t) + 32
When t = 0;
F(0) = 1.8 * C(0) + 32 = 1.8 * (0) + 32 = 32
When t = 1;
F(1) = 1.8 * C(1) + 32 = 1.8 * (100) + 32 = 180 + 32 = 212
Celsius to Fahrenheit:
C(t) = F(t) – 32 / 1.8
When t = 0;
C(0) = F(0) – 32 / 1.8 = (32) – 32 / 1.8 = 0
When t = 1;
C(1) = F(1) – 32 / 1.8 = (212) – 32 / 1.8 = 100



C)
1.) I drew a simple sphere which is centered at origin using 6 longitudinal lines and 2 latitudinal lines. This demonstrated that the sphere is made from a combination of triangles and quadrilaterals wherein the triangles take up the top and bottom portion of the sphere where the longitudinal lines converge. Whereas the quadrilaterals mainly take up the middle portion of the sphere.
Doing this I could conclude that in order to approximate a sphere we would require both triangles and quadrilaterals. Because even in case of a greater number of latitude and longitudinal lines the top and bottom would be consisted of triangles where the longitudinal lines will converge and the middle portion would consist of quadrilaterals.


2.) Suppose a line segment 'L' is made by joining the endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). And a rectangular window 'R' with coordinates (a1, a2), (b1, b2), (c1, c2), (d1, d2). Then to determine if L is getting clipped by R then we just need to verify that the endpoints of L lie within R by checking if each endpoint coordinate value of L is greater than or less than the left/right/top/bottom edge of R.
For example, to know if endpoint (x2, y2) lies within one edge of R suppose (c1, c2) and (d1, d2). Then check if (x1 < c1 and x1 < d1). If this condition fails that means the endpoint lies outside the limits of the window R and vice versa.



D)
a.) The stage that precedes the Primitive Assembly is the Vertex Processing and Transformation wherein each vertex is processed by each Vertex Shader to know the actual location of the vertex in the appropriate coordinate system. The stage that follows Primitive Assembly is Fragment Texturing and Coloring which is also called the Fragment Shader wherein each fragment are assigned a color. Hence Primitive Assembly takes in a set of vertices generated by the Vertex Shader and outputs a rendering object.


b.) The vertices data is collected to form some geometric object. Hence different primitives that may need getting assembled are coordinates or vertices and edges i.e. points, line segments, polygons, curves and surfaces. For example, if the input is three vertices and the topology is of a traingle then the output that would be generated is of 1 traingle.
