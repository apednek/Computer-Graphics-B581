I followed and completed the steps from "Modeling a Robot Arm (animated) in Unity by Scripting" documentation.
After completing all the steps I tried doing some experimentation of my own by changing the eulerAngles of the Shoulder and Arm gameObjects. Also tried giving eulerAngles to the other gameObjects just to see their behaviour.

Issues encountered with the software:
I encountered a buggy behavior with Unity wherein it was not autocompiling my scripts. Had to do a "refresh" and restart Unity for it to work.
