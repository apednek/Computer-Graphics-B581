There are few changes which I made to the `Line Renderer` components which are used. I changed their `Order in Layer` values because after following the order values from the problem-set description they were getting rendered above the `Point` gameObjects. Also I had made changes to the color values of the `Line Rendere` because after following the description it was only coloring one half of the segment.
