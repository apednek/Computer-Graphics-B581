I used Unity 2020.3.16f1 version fo problem-set-01.
Find the following scripts inside the project:
- DragObject.cs
- SplineSegmentCPUCompute.cs
- SplineParameters.cs

I have completed both Task A and Task B of problem-set-02.

I was able to complete the tasks with the help of the readings and lecture notes. While exploring the `Button` components of Unity I also experimented with the `Button` features. I found this problem set quite interesting.
