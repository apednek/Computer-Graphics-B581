I used Unity 2020.3.16f1 version fo problem-set-01.
Find the following scripts inside the project:
- DragObject.cs
- LineUtility.cs
- PolygonPositionLines.cs
- SingleSegmentPositionLines.cs

I have completed both Task A and Task B of problem-set-01.

There are few changes which I made to the `Line Renderer` components which are used. I changed their `Order in Layer` values because after following the order values from the problem-set description they were getting rendered above the `Point` gameObjects. Also I had made changes to the color values of the `Line Rendere` because after following the description it was only coloring one half of the segment.
To achieve the results for both the tasks the class notes were very helpful. I followed the steps from `Lecture 8` to map to the given helper code in `SingleSegmentPositionLines.cs`
