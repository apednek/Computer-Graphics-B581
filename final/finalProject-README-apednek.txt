Final Project

I used Unity 2020.3.16f1 version for the final project.

A. 3D Scene: Models and Surfaces:
- My scene has a terrain which is created algorithmically using GPU shader.
- The two christmas trees are my non-trivial object which I created through my CPU script. These trees are animated(rotating) using the script.

B. User Interaction:
- The two pendulums are user-controlled objects so the user can tap on them to add momentum. These two pendulums also interact with each other when they collide.

C. Camera positioning:
- The two GUI "sliders" control the camera movement. One controls the camera horizontally and the other vertically.

D. Illumination:
- The green sphere looking object is my light source. A small "cross" appears on it to indicate if the light source is on/off.
- The "light" GUI button controls the light source toggle. 

E. Mapping
- The grass and brick-like looking cubes are created by texture-mapping. These cubes also have the rolling-ball algorithm applied to them.
Hence these cubes rotate when the user drags them.

F. Help screen:
- The "Heads-up-Display" is the help screen. This help-screen can be enabled and disabled by pressing the "H" button on the keyboard.
